# Python - Async

The project encompasses tasks of concurrency in python (cooperative multi-tasking).

## Concurrency :

The dictionary definition of concurrency is simultaneous occurrence. In Python, the things that are occurring simultaneously are called by different names (thread, task, process) but at a high level, they all refer to a sequence of instructions that run in order.
I like to think of them as different trains of thought. Each one can be stopped at certain points, and the CPU or brain that is processing them can switch to a different one. The state of each one is saved so it can be restarted right where it was interrupted.

## Learning Objectives :

+ async and await syntax
+ How to execute an async program with asyncio
+ How to run concurrent coroutines
+ How to create asyncio tasks
+ How to use the random module
